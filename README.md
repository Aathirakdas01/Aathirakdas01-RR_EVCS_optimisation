# EVCS Placement Optimisation on Sioux Falls Network

This project formulates and solves an electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) placement optimisation problem using the **Sioux Falls transportation network**. The objective is to **minimise total operational cost** while ensuring all EV demand is met.

## üìÅ Folder Structure
- `data/`: Raw or processed input data
- `Output/`: Trained models and scalers
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks (exploration, training, etc.)
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for modular code (e.g., training, plotting)
- `config.py`: Central config (paths, hyperparams, etc.)
- `functions.py`: Utility functions for loading, scaling, training
- `_init_.py`: Centralized shared imports

## üß† Problem Description

We model the network as a set of nodes and links. Each node may have a certain EV charging demand. The goal is to determine:
- Where to place charging stations (subject to a budget on number of stations),
- How to assign each node‚Äôs demand to installed stations,
- While minimising:
  - Fixed cost of installing stations,
  - Variable cost of serving demand (proportional to distance).

## üßÆ Optimisation Model

### Decision Variables
- `x[j] ‚àà {0,1}`: whether to install a station at node `j`.
- `y[i,j] ‚â• 0`: amount of demand from node `i` assigned to station at node `j`.

### Objective
Minimise total cost:
Total Cost = Œ£ (x[j] √ó station_cost) + Œ£ (y[i,j] √ó distance[i,j] √ó per_km_cost)

### Constraints
- Each node‚Äôs full demand must be met.
- Demand can only be assigned to nodes where a station is placed.
- Stations can only be assigned if within a given **coverage radius**.
- The number of stations is limited (`max_stations`).
