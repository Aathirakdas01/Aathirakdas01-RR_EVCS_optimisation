# \# EVCS Placement Optimisation on Sioux Falls Network

# 

# This project formulates and solves an electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) placement optimisation problem using the \*\*Sioux Falls transportation network\*\*. The objective is to \*\*minimise total operational cost\*\* while ensuring all EV demand is met.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 🧠 Problem Description

# 

# We model the network as a set of nodes and links. Each node may have a certain EV charging demand. The goal is to determine:

# \- Where to place charging stations (subject to a budget on number of stations),

# \- How to assign each node’s demand to installed stations,

# \- While minimising:

# &nbsp; - Fixed cost of installing stations,

# &nbsp; - Variable cost of serving demand (proportional to distance).

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 🧮 Optimisation Model

# 

# \### Decision Variables

# \- `x\[j] ∈ {0,1}`: whether to install a station at node `j`.

# \- `y\[i,j] ≥ 0`: amount of demand from node `i` assigned to station at node `j`.

# 

# \### Objective

# Minimise total cost:

# Total Cost = Σ (x\[j] × station\_cost) + Σ (y\[i,j] × distance\[i,j] × per\_km\_cost)

# 

# \### Constraints

# \- Each node’s full demand must be met.

# \- Demand can only be assigned to nodes where a station is placed.

# \- Stations can only be assigned if within a given \*\*coverage radius\*\*.

# \- The number of stations is limited (`max\_stations`).
